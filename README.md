Motivation
----------

When reading XML/markup data on the server, I often reach for a
jQuery-esque tool using CSS selectors to extract various bits of the
document. There are [solutions][1] solving that problem already,
however jQuery is an acquired taste, and with my latest foragings into
[functional programming][2], those API:s just feel awkward.

### Installing with NPM

```bash
npm install -S zu
```

Use in a project

```javascript
var zu = require('zu');

var nodes = zu.parse(<some xml string>);
var subs  = zu.find(nodes, 'div#a > span.b');
```

### Goals

* Composable [curried][4] functions, not methods.

* Selectors return `Array`s, not "array-like objects". This means
  functional libraries such as [fnuc][2] and [Ramda][3] can
  interoperate.

* Reading, not manipulating. This cuts out a lot of code as well as
  avoids awkward jQuery style dual-purpose functions (get/set).

* Performance. Especially matching should be fast.

* XML bias. HTML is the odd one out. Namespaces do not need escaping
  in selector expressions (`zu.find(nodes, 'e:event')`).

## Example

```javascript
var zu = require('zu');
var fs = require('fs');

// parse an xml document to array of nodes.
var xml = zu.parseXml(fs.readFileSync('./mydoc.xml', 'utf-8'));

// partial application to make function that does a find over the xml.
var fn = zu.findWith(xml);

// find some elements. this is just a plain array of
// nodes. the nodes are inspected using the api.
var events = fn('e:eventList > e:event');

// use regular Array.prototype.map
var myresult = events.map(function(ev) {

    // function bound to the events.
    var efn = zu.findWith(ev);

    // extract some interesting data.
    return {
        eventId:   zu.text(efn('e:eventId')),
        title:     zu.text(efn('e:title')),
        startTime: zu.text(efn('e:startTime')),
        eventXml:  zu.xml(ev)     // event as an xml string
    };

});
```

## The DOM nodes

Most functions `find`, `closest`, `next` etc accept and return an
array of nodes. Where the API accepts an array of nodes in, you can
also use a single node without a wrapping array as well. The return
type will however always be an array.

```javascipt
var html = parseHtml(someStr);

var dom1 = zu.find(html, 'div');
var dom2 = zu.find(html[0], 'div'); // we can use non-array

// dom1 and dom2 are different arrays
// with the same nodes inside.
```

The node's datastructure is considered opaque (it is htmlparser2
[domhandler object](https://github.com/fb55/domhandler)). This
implementation may change, so accessing the internal of those objects
may be breaking. The way to get data out are:

* [`zu.text(node or nodes)`](#text)
* [`zu.attr(node or nodes, attrname)`](#attr)
* [`zu.xml(node or nodes)`](#xml)
* [`zu.html(node or nodes)`](#html)


## Curry

Each `zu.[something](n,e)` that takes two arguments also have two
curried version `zu.[something]With(n)` and `zu.[something]With(e)`
Example illustrated with `zu.parent`.

##### Both arguments

`:: [n], s -> [n]`

No curry here.

```javascript
zu.parent(nodes, exp);
```

##### One argument

`:: [n] -> [n]

Equivalent to having `null` as second argument.

```javascript
zu.parent(nodes);
```

##### Partially applied nodes

`:: [n] -> s -> [n]`

Provided an array, gives a function expecting the expression.

```javascript
zu.parentWith(nodes);
```

##### Partially applied with expression

`:: s -> [n] -> [n]`

Provided an expression, gives a function expecting an array.

```javascript
zu.parentWith(exp);
```


## CSS Selectors

The following selectors are (currently) supported:

* Type selector `div`
* All selector `*`
* Descendant `div span`
* Child `div > span`. Also works as `> span` for immediate children.
* Class `div.foo`
* Id `div#bar`
* Namespace `e|div`, but also `e:div` for names not clashing with pseudo-classes.
* Attributes with or without quotes
  - exists `div[foo]`
  - equals `div[foo=bar]`
  - whitespace separated match `div[foo~=bar]`
  - hyphenated start match `div[foo|=bar]`
  - starts with `div[foo^=bar]`
  - ends with `div[foo$=bar]`
  - substring `div[foo*=bar]`
* Pseudo-classes
  - contains specified text `:contains()`
  - that have no children `:empty`
  - first child of parent `:first-child`
  - last child of parent `:last-child`

## API

### Parsing

##### parseXml

`zu.parseXml(str)`

`:: s -> [n]`

Parse an XML string to an array of nodes.

##### parseHtml

`zu.parseHtml(str)`

Parse an HTML string to an array of nodes. The difference from XML is
that certain HTML elements get special treatment. `<script>` contents
are not further parsed, `<img>` tags does not need closing etc.

`:: s -> [n]`


### Data out

##### xml

`zu.xml(nodes)`

Turn given array of nodes into a string XML form.

`:: [n] -> s`

##### html

`zu.html(nodes)`

Turn given array of nodes into a string HTML form.

`:: [n] -> s`

##### text

`zu.text(nodes)`

Turn given array of text nodes into a string, where the
contents of each node is concatenated together.

`:: [n] -> s`

##### attr

`zu.attr(nodes, name)`

Return the attribute value for `names` from the first element in the
given array of nodes.

`:: [n], s -> s`

Also `zu.attrWith(nodes or name)`

`:: [n] -> s  -> s`  
`:: s  -> [n] -> s`

##### hasClass

Test whether any node in the given array of nodes has a `name` as a
class.

`zu.hasClass(nodes, name)`

`:: [n], s -> s`

Also `zu.hasClassWith(nodes or name)`

`:: [n] -> s  -> s`  
`:: s  -> [n] -> s`



### Selectors

##### find

`zu.find(nodes, exp)`

Match the given nodes, and any descendants of the given nodes against
the given expression.

`:: [n], s -> [n]`

Also `zu.findWith(nodes or exp)`

`:: s  -> [n] -> [n]`  
`:: [n] -> s  -> [n]`

##### children

Match the immediate children of the given nodes against the given
expression. Also `zu.children(nodes)` to get immediate children without
any filtering expression.

`zu.children(nodes, exp)`

`:: [n], s -> [n]`  
`:: [n] -> [n]`

Also `zu.childrenWith(nodes or exp)`

`:: s  -> [n] -> [n]`  
`:: [n] -> s  -> [n]`

#####  closest

`zu. closest(nodes, exp)`

Test the given set of nodes and recursively parent nodes against
expression and return the first match.

`:: [n], s -> [n]`  
`:: [n] -> [n]`

Also `zu.closestWith(nodes or exp)`

`:: s  -> [n] -> [n]`  
`:: [n] -> s  -> [n]`

##### filter

`zu.filter(nodes, exp)`

Filter the given set of nodes using the expression. Also
`zu.filter(nodes)` just returns the same nodes (however in a new array).

`:: [n], s -> [n]`  
`:: [n] -> [n]`

Also `filterWith(nodes or exp)`

`:: s  -> [n] -> [n]`  
`:: [n] -> s  -> [n]`

##### is

`zu.is(nodes, exp)`

Filter the given set of nodes using the expression and tell whether
any matched.

`:: [n], s -> bool`  
`:: [n] -> bool`

Also `zu.isWith(nodes or exp)`

`:: s  -> [n] -> bool`  
`:: [n] -> s  -> bool`

##### next

`zu.next(nodes, exp)`

Select immediate sibling nodes to the right of given nodes, optionally
apply a filter expression.

`:: [n], s -> [n]`  
`:: [n] -> [n]`

Also `zu.nextWith(nodes or exp)`

`:: s  -> [n] -> [n]`  
`:: [n] -> s  -> [n]`

##### nextAll

`zu.nextAll(nodes, exp)`

Select all sibling nodes to the right of the given nodes, optionally
filtered by an expression.

`:: s  -> [n] -> [n]`  
`:: [n] -> s  -> [n]`

##### parents

`zu.parents(nodes, exp)`

Select all parent nodes of given nodes, optionally filtered by an
expression.

`:: [n], s -> [n]`

Minimal DOM grokking with CSS style selectors

Motivation
----------

When reading XML/markup data on the server, I often reach for a
jQuery-esque tool using CSS selectors to extract various bits of the
document. There are [solutions][1] solving that problem already,
however jQuery is an acquired taste, and with my latest foragings into
[functional programming][2], those API:s just feel awkward.

### Goals

* Selectors returns `Array`s, not array-like objects. This means
  functional libraries such as [fnuc][2] and [Ramda][3] can
  interoperate.

* Reading, not manipulating. This cuts out a lot of code as well as
  avoids awkward jQuery style dual-purpose functions (get/set).

* Performance. Especially matching should be fast.
